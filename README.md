Class project for ECE 579C: Applied Cryptography and Physical Attacks

An early-stage implementation of a cloud co-location attack on Amazon AWS.

This tool requires [boto](http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/getting_started.html).
We assume that you have created a file called ~/.boto in which you store your
  AWS access key.

To start an instance, import the module "instances" and then run
startOneDefaultInstance().

We assume that Windows usage is possible, but we have not tried it. Sorry.
