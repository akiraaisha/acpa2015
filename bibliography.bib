    Demonstrates a practical, fast, realistic full key recovery against AES across virtual machines.
    The attack is based on the \name{Flush+Reload} attack from Gullasch \latin{et al.} \cite{gullasch2011cache}.
    It works against any T-table based cipher implementation, but only when the VMs are using same sort of memory
      sharing mechanism such as VMware TPS. Key recovery takes about one minute (400,000~encryptions) in a realistic
      cross-VM setting.
